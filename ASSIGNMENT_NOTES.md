# Assignment Notes - Participation 3

## What Was Implemented

This is a **lightweight skeleton** (as requested in the assignment instructions) demonstrating the State Pattern structure.

### Components Created

1. **State Interfaces** (2 files)
   - `IProjectState.cs` - Defines 8 operations for projects
   - `ITaskState.cs` - Defines 4 operations for tasks

2. **Context Classes** (2 files)
   - `Project.cs` - Delegates to current project state
   - `Task.cs` - Delegates to current task state

3. **Concrete State Classes** (2 files)
   - `ProjectStates.cs` - 8 states (Draft, Submitted, Approved, Active, AtRisk, OnHold, Completed, Archived)
   - `TaskStates.cs` - 5 states (Pending, Assigned, InProgress, Completed, Verified)

4. **Demo** (1 file)
   - `Program.cs` - Simple demonstration showing transitions

### Key Design Points

**Structure:**
- Each state implements the interface (required by C#)
- Valid transitions call `context.SetState(new NextState())`
- Invalid transitions are empty methods with comments (keeping it lightweight)

**Why Every State Has All Methods:**
- C# interfaces require implementation of ALL methods
- This is actually a feature - compiler enforces completeness
- Each state only implements valid transitions, others are no-ops

**Delegation Pattern:**
```csharp
// Context delegates to state
public void Submit() => _currentState.Submit(this);

// State handles transition
public void Submit(Project context) => context.SetState(new SubmittedState());
```

### Benefits Demonstrated

1. **No nested switches** - Each state is a separate class
2. **Easy to extend** - Add new state by creating new class
3. **Compiler enforced** - Must implement all interface methods
4. **Clear structure** - State logic is localized

### How It's "Lightweight"

- No detailed error messages (just comments)
- No extensive logging
- Minimal demo (just shows basic flow)
- Focuses on **structure** not implementation details
